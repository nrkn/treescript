# treescript

Hyperscript-like creation of generic trees in typescript

`npm install @nrkn/treescript`

This package came about because I was really interested in how  `symbol-tree` 
worked, so I cloned it as a learning exercise. Once it was passing the test 
suite for real `symbol-tree`, I ended up building the other parts on top of that 
as I wanted something as concise, readable and composable as hyperscript, but
for generic tree nodes of varying kinds.

## Usage

We have three levels of abstraction:

1. High - treescript - [hyperscript](https://github.com/hyperhype/hyperscript) 
   like creation of trees
2. Mid - wnode - creation of nodes, similar to the DOM, backing treescript
3. Low - stree - a [symbol-tree](https://github.com/jsdom/js-symbol-tree) clone, 
   backing for wnode

### treescript

Create `wnode` instances with a hyperscript-like syntax. More on `wnode` later.

#### t

```ts
type TArg<T> = Wnode | Partial<T>

const t: <T extends {}>(initial: T, ...args: TArg<T>[]) => Wnode<T>
```

The initial value sets the type of the node.

The `args` can be a mix of `Partial<T>` and `Wnode`, the partials are 
applied to the initial value, and the nodes are added as children.

```js
import { t } from '@nrkn/treescript'

const clubs = t(
  { type: 'clubs' },
  t( 
    { type: 'club', name: 'star gazers' },
    t( 'alex sun' ),
    t( 'nick moon' )
  ),
  t( 
    { type: 'club', name: 'wildlife watchers' },
    t( 'quinn bird' ),
    t( 'blake bear' ),
    // I'm guessing someone in the club added this - this partial will override
    // the name of the club - this pattern is useful for composition
    { name: 'the best wildlife watchers club' }
  )
)

const people = clubs.all( n => typeof n.value === 'string' )

for( const person of people ){
  console.log( person.value )
}
```

#### ne

Like `t`, but with no initial value required, therefore the node type is 'any',
and the value is the composite of all non-node arguments. Useful for 
composition, eg

```js
import { ne } from '@nrkn/treescript'

const feature1 = { fast: true }
const feature2 = { shinyButtons: true }

const machine = ne(
  { name: 'embiggening inversocatorer' }, feature1, feature2,
  ne(
    { name: 'inversocatorer dial' }, feature2
  )
)
```

#### tOf

Takes a `create` function and returns a function similar to `t`, but which
has its initial value populated by the `create` function, so doesn't need to be
passed in.

```js
import { tOf } from '@nrkn/treescript'

const createOutfit = () => ({ type: 'outfit', hasPockets: true, name: '' })
const createHat = () => ({ type: 'hat', hatBrimSize: 'medium', name: '' })
const createCoat = () => ({ type: 'coat', isWaterproof: false, name: '' })
const createPants = () => ({ type: 'pants', numberOfBeltLoops: 6, name: '' })
const createDress = () => ({ type: 'dress', twirlFactor: 'high', name: '' })
const createTop = () => ({ type: 'top', hasSequins: true, name: '' })

const outfit = tOf( createOutfit )
const hat = tOf( createHat )
const coat = tOf( createCoat )
const pants = tOf( createPants )
const dress = tOf( createDress )
const top = tOf( createTop )

const myOutfit = outfit(
  { name: 'dancing outfit' },

  hat({ name: 'witch hat', hatBrimSize: 'enormous' }),
  dress({ name: 'polka dot dress' }),
  top({ name: 'sparkly blouse' })
)

```

### wnode

The backing node for `treescript` is `wnode`, which is similar to a DOM node in
operation, but has a different API. It is basically just a light weight wrapper
around `symbol-tree`

The custom value is stored in `wnode.value`

```ts
import { wnode } from '@nrkn/treescript'

const chest = wnode({ type: 'chest', capacity: 10, used: 0, size: 12 })
const sword = wnode({ type: 'sword', quality: 'rusty af', size: 3 })

const addToContainer = ( container, item } ) => {
  const { value: c } = container
  const { value: i } = item

  if( ( c.used + i.size ) > c.capacity ){
    return false
  }

  container.appendChild( item )
  c.used += i.size

  return true
}

if( !addToContainer( chest, sword ) ){
  console.log( 'no room for sword' )
}
```

#### properties

```ts
type WnodeProps<T = any> = {
  value: T
  children: IterableIterator<Wnode>
  ancestors: IterableIterator<Wnode>
  descendants: IterableIterator<Wnode>
  previousSiblings: IterableIterator<Wnode>
  nextSiblings: IterableIterator<Wnode>
  
  parent: MaybeNode // Wnode | null
  prev: MaybeNode
  next: MaybeNode
  firstChild: MaybeNode
  lastChild: MaybeNode

  isAttached: boolean
  hasChildren: boolean

  index: number
  childrenCount: number
}
```

#### methods

```ts
type WnodeMethods = {
  remove: () => Wnode
  insertBefore: (newNode: Wnode, referenceNode: MaybeNode) => Wnode
  insertAfter: (newNode: Wnode, referenceNode: MaybeNode) => Wnode
  prependChild: (newNode: Wnode) => Wnode
  appendChild: (newNode: Wnode) => Wnode
  compareTreePosition: (otherNode: Wnode) => number
  lastInclusiveDescendant: () => Wnode  
  preceding: (options?: SincdescOpts<Wnode>) => MaybeNode
  following: (options?: SincdescOpts<Wnode>) => MaybeNode
}
```

#### utils

Decorate `wnode` instances with custom methods. 

```js
import { wdoc } from '@nrkn/treescript'
import { myCustom } from './custom'

const wnode = wdoc( myCustom )

const myNode = wnode({ name: 'hello' })
```

There is an example provided that adds the following useful methods:

```ts
type WnodeSelector = (node: Wnode) => boolean

type WnodeUtils = {
  after: (...nodes: Wnode[]) => void
  append: (...nodes: Wnode[]) => void
  before: (...nodes: Wnode[]) => void
  prepend: (...nodes: Wnode[]) => void

  replaceChildren: (...nodes: Wnode[]) => void
  replaceWith: (...nodes: Wnode[]) => void

  ancestor: (selector: WnodeSelector) => MaybeNode
  find: (selector: WnodeSelector) => MaybeNode
  all: (selector: WnodeSelector) => IterableIterator<Wnode>
  matches: (selector: WnodeSelector) => boolean
}
```

```js
import { wdoc, wnodeUtils } from '@nrkn/treescript'

const wnode = wdoc( wnodeUtils )
```

If you use a custom util, the instances created by `wnode` will be typed with 
your additional methods. 

Custom utils are structured like so:

```ts
export const wnodeUtils: WutilFactory<WnodeUtils> = (node: Wnode) => {
  const utils: WnodeUtils = {
    after(...nodes) {
      for (const n of nodes) {
        node.insertAfter(n, node)
      }
    },
    // etc
  }

  return utils
}
```

You can only pass through a single utils object - if you want to use multiple, 
to eg extend wnodeUtils, you can do with a pattern like this:

```ts
import { wnodeUtils, wdoc } from '@nrkn/treescript'

const myUtils = node => {
  const baseUtils = wnodeUtils( node )

  return {
    ...baseUtils,
    myCustomMethod() {
      console.log( 
        `this node's value has ${ Object.keys( node.value ).length } keys` 
      )
    }
  }
}

const wnode = wdoc( myUtils )
```

### stree

`stree` is a clone of `symbol-tree`, but ported to functional style typescript 
and using conventions that I find comfortable. It's used to create the backing 
tree for `wnode`. It has the same interface as the official `symbol-tree` 
package, except instances are generated via `stree()` rather than 
`new SymbolTree()`

```js
import { stree } from '@nrkn/treescript'

const tree = stree()

let a = {foo: 'bar'} // or `new Whatever()`
let b = {foo: 'baz'}
let c = {foo: 'qux'}

tree.insertBefore(b, a) // insert a before b
tree.insertAfter(b, c) // insert c after b

console.log(tree.nextSibling(a) === b)
console.log(tree.nextSibling(b) === c)
console.log(tree.previousSibling(c) === b)

tree.remove(b)
console.log(tree.nextSibling(a) === c)
```
